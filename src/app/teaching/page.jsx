                      that I can apply outside of the classroom. Was very accommodating and can really tell he has a passion 
                      for what he is teaching. I enjoyed going to class and participating, and feel I will use this knowledge 
                      beyond this course."

                      for the first time, and I liked how interactive this class was. This was the first business class I have 
                      ever taken, and I felt like it was very informative and applicable. Professor Kang clearly has a very strong 
                      background in business, and it showed through his teaching."

                      It is definitely a tough course and there is no easy A, especially when it comes to participation 
                      and speaking up in class, but Professor Kang was amazing."
