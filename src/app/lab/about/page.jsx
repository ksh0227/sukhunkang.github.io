              <li>
                I am usually looking for research assistants to help me on ongoing research projects, 
                especially those with data analytics skills (e.g., Stata, R, Python). Econometric training 
                including exposure to quasi-experimental research designs is also preferred.

              <li>
                My research usually looks at the intersection of innovation and entrepreneurship, especially 
                within the biopharmaceutical and high-tech industries. My work explores the intricate ways in 
                which technology influences innovation, aiming to identify the key drivers and obstacles to 
                technology adoption and its effects on individuals, firms, and our society.
              </li>
              <li>
                My research also investigates the broader implications of technology and innovation, with an 
                emphasis on how technology alters firm strategy and behavior. My goal is to deepen our 
                understanding of how to effectively use technology to foster innovation within a business context.

                Health Innovation Working Group is a student-led research seminar series that focuses on social 
                science research related to the pharmaceutical industry and the healthcare sector. Our goal is to 
                provide a platform for PhD students and junior faculty members in disciplines such as strategy, 
                economics, health policy, entrepreneurship, and innovation (or related fields) to present their 
                working papers and receive feedback from a friendly crowd.
